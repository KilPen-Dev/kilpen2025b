## Business Problem

The organization faced challenges with poor product quality exiting their product development workflows. Since multiple contributors participated in development with varying quality levels, a systematic approach was needed.

## Mission

Develop a process and supporting tool to enable a quality check of each contributor early in the development cycle using Google Workspace, aiming to reduce errors and rework downstream.

## Solution

A gate review process was implemented where quality teams assessed contributor work samples within ten days of engagement. Teams evaluated products and selected risk treatments:

- **Mitigate** - Reduce the likelihood or impact
- **Avoid** - Eliminate the risk entirely
- **Transfer** - Shift the risk to another party
- **Accept** - Acknowledge and monitor the risk

Google Sheets, Gmail, and Forms provided automation for:

- Tracking review deadlines
- Sending notifications
- Recording completion results

## Timeline

**Project Duration:** Five weeks
